            <p>
              InaSAFE is free software that produces realistic natural hazard impact scenarios for better
              planning, preparedness and response activities. It provides a simple but rigorous way to combine
              data from scientists, local governments and communities to provide insights into the likely impacts 
              of future disaster events.
            More Details can be found

            <h3>
            About Dar es Salaam
          </h3>

            <p>
             Dar es-Salaam has been experiencing major flood disasters following the 
             continuing heavy rains. The floods have affected the lives of citizens, injured many, 
             destroyed houses, affected several infrastructures like bridges, loss of property and
              weakened various social and economic activities.
             
            </p>
            <h3>
            Better Planning to Save Lives
          </h3>

            <p>
             This InaSAFE version supports the user to input area to be examined with its population
             data and  input hazard layer(floods layer) then the analysis can be done over the area.
             For example user enters Tandale area and create and fill the population column on the layer
             , the results will be respectively with the data provided from the user.
             This help much, as the its flexible and can be easily updated as compared to fetching data
             from other organization such as Worlp Population which can sometimes be not updated.
             
            </p>
             <h3>
            Technical Part
          </h3>

            <p>
            InaSAFE uses Impact Functions as the main part for execution of the analysis calculations.
            The Impact Function is the one responsible for the main calculations of how the impact caused 
            by a certain hazard(flood,tsunami,volcano...) affects a certain exposure(building,road,land cover,population...).
            Currently each hazard and exposure pair(eg. Flood and Roads,Floods and Buildings) has its own Impact Function.
            </p>
            <p> In our case we have wards with population. 
            So we have added a new Impact Function that will calculate the number of people that will be affected in the event of Flood,
             the current assumption is that the population is uniformly distributed. 

           
            <ol>
             The whole process of adding new Impact Function includes
             <li>Adding new module(contains the code with main calculations)</li>
             <li>Adding parameters and metadata that the Impact Function will deal with.</li>
             <li>Adding testing data and Unit Testing</li>
            </ol>
             
            </p>
